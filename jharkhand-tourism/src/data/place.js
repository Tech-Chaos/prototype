      description: "Nestled amidst a verdant expanse, approximately 45 kilometers from the bustling heart of Ranchi, lies Johna Falls. Now, you might hear the locals call it Gautamdhara,. This isn't one of those roaring, thunderous cascades that you have to shout over. Johna is a more graceful affair, a \"hanging valley\" waterfall, where the Kanchi River takes a scenic plunge of approximately 43 meters (roughly 141 feet) into a stunning valley."
